### Multiple Choice Question Format

1. **Algorithm Name: Reversed Number (LeetCode 7)**
   - **Core Idea:** Determine if an integer reads the same backward as forward.
   - **Step 1:** What should you do first to reverse the integer?
     - a) Initialize a variable to store the reversed number -- correct
     - b) Convert the integer to a string -- subsequent step if you choose to reverse the number using string manipulation
   - **Step 2:** After obtaining the last digit, what is the next step?
     - a) Add the digit to the reversed number - add the digit to the reversed number variable
     - b) Subtract the digit from the original number



2. **Algorithm Name: Roman to Integer (LeetCode 13)**
   - **Core Idea:** Convert a Roman numeral string to its corresponding integer value.
   - **Step 1:** What should you check for each character in the string?
     - a) If it is a valid Roman numeral
     - b) If it is the last character in the string
   - **Step 2:** If the current numeral is less than the next, what should you do?
     - a) Add the current value to the result
     - b) Subtract the current value from the result

3. **Algorithm Name: Longest Common Prefix (LeetCode 14)**
   - **Core Idea:** Find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.
   - **Step 1:** What should you do if the input array is empty?
     - a) Return the first string
     - b) Return an empty string
   - **Step 2:** While checking each string, what should you do if the prefix is not found?
     - a) Stop checking further
     - b) Shorten the prefix by one character

4. **Algorithm Name: Two Sum (LeetCode 1)**
   - **Core Idea:** Find two numbers in an array that add up to a target value.
   - **Step 1:** What should you do for each number in the array?
     - a) Check if it is equal to the target
     - b) Calculate its complement with respect to the target
   - **Step 2:** If the complement exists in the map, what should you return?
     - a) The indices of the two numbers
     - b) The sum of the two numbers

### Quiz Question

- a) Improved code readability
- b) Increased code complexity
- c) Encapsulation of specific tasks
- d) Potential for code reuse

**Answer:** b) Increased code complexity
