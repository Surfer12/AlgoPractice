Sure, let's break down the [`longestCommonPrefix`] method into a step-by-step multiple-choice problem, focusing on what each step should be.

### Step-by-Step Multiple Choice Problem

#### Step 1: Initial Check
What should the first step be in the [`longestCommonPrefix`] method?
- A) Initialize a variable to store the longest common prefix.
- B) Check if the input array is null or empty.
- C) Sort the array of strings.
- D) Return the first string in the array.

**Answer:** B) Check if the input array is null or empty.

#### Step 2: Return Value for Empty Input
What should the method return if the input array is null or empty?
- A) `null`
- B) `0`
- C) `""` (an empty string)
- D) The first string in the array

**Answer:** C) `""` (an empty string)

#### Step 3: Initialize Prefix
What should be the initial value of the prefix?
- A) The longest string in the array
- B) The shortest string in the array
- C) The first string in the array
- D) An empty string

**Answer:** C) The first string in the array

#### Step 4: Loop Through Strings
What should the method do after initializing the prefix?
- A) Concatenate all strings in the array.
- B) Loop through each string in the array starting from the second string.
- C) Sort the array of strings.
- D) Convert all strings to lowercase.

**Answer:** B) Loop through each string in the array starting from the second string.

#### Step 5: Adjust Prefix
Inside the loop, what should the method do to adjust the prefix?
- A) Append characters to the prefix.
- B) Remove characters from the prefix until it matches the start of the current string.
- C) Replace the prefix with the current string.
- D) Convert the prefix to uppercase.

**Answer:** B) Remove characters from the prefix until it matches the start of the current string.

#### Step 6: Return the Result
What should the method return at the end?
- A) The longest string in the array
- B) The shortest string in the array
- C) The longest common prefix
- D) The concatenated string of all elements in the array

**Answer:** C) The longest common prefix

### Summary of Steps
1. **Check if the input array is null or empty.**
   - If true, return an empty string.
2. **Initialize the prefix with the first string in the array.**
3. **Loop through each string in the array starting from the second string.**
4. **Adjust the prefix by removing characters until it matches the start of the current string.**
5. **Return the longest common prefix.**

This breakdown should help in understanding the logical steps involved in solving the problem.
