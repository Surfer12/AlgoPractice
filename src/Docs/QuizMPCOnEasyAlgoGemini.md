     - b) Subtract the current value from the result

3. **Algorithm Name: Longest Common Prefix (LeetCode 14)**
   - **Core Idea:** Find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.
   - **Step 1:** What should you do if the input array is empty?
     - a) Return the first string
     - b) Return an empty string
   - **Step 2:** While checking each string, what should you do if the prefix is not found?
     - a) Stop checking further
     - b) Shorten the prefix by one character

4. **Algorithm Name: Two Sum (LeetCode 1)**
   - **Core Idea:** Find two numbers in an array that add up to a target value.
   - **Step 1:** What should you do for each number in the array?
     - a) Check if it is equal to the target
     - b) Calculate its complement with respect to the target
   - **Step 2:** If the complement exists in the map, what should you return?
     - a) The indices of the two numbers
     - b) The sum of the two numbers
